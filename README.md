### My Project
I'm planning to work on a project that connects family members that speak different native languages through instant translation. As the child of an immigrant, I've struggled with communicating effectively with my parents, grandparents, and extended family all my life. I hope that by providing a clean, easy-to-use interface, I can drive seamless communication between all generations alike.
