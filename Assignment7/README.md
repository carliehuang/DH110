# DH110 Assignment 7: High-Fidelity Interactive Prototype
Carlie Huang, Spring 2023

## Introduction
My project, Bridge, aims to overcome inter-generation language barriers via instant-translation messaging. The purpose of this high-fidelity interactive prototype is to serve as a detailed representation of the app. It provides a realistic and interactive experience so that users and employees alike can visualize and understand the final product's look, feel, and functionality. By incorporating rich visual design elements, accurate content, and interactive features, it enables designers, developers, and users to test and validate various aspects of the product, such as user interactions, usability, and aesthetics. This type of prototype helps identify potential issues early on, gather feedback, and make informed design decisions, ultimately improving the final product's quality and user experience.

## Tasks
The four tasks represented in my interactive prototype are:
1. Sign up/Log in
2. Add a chat
3. Send a message
4. Translate a message

## Wireflow
My wireflow:

Because there are many screens and the wireflow is quite complex, I would reccomend taking a look inside the Figma file linked in the following section.
